DjVu can be seen as superior alternative to PDF and\r\nPostscript for digital documents, to TIFF (and PDF) for scanned documents, to\r\nJPEG for photographs and pictures, and to GIF for large palettized\r\nimages. DjVu is the only Web format that is practical for distributing\r\nhigh-resolution scanned documents in color. No other format comes close.\r\n\r\nTypical DjVu file sizes are as follows: \r\n\r\n- Bitonal scanned documents: \r\n        5 to 30KB per page at 300dpi, \r\n        3 to 10 times smaller than PDF or TIFF.\r\n\r\n- Color scanned documents: \r\n           30 to 100KB per page at 300dpi,\r\n           5 to 10 times smaller than JPEG.\r\n\r\n- Photos:\r\n        2 times smaller than JPEG, \r\n        about the same as JPEG-2000. \r\n\r\n- Palettized images: \r\n        2 times smaller than GIF,\r\n        up to 10 times if there is text.\r\n\r\nDjVu is used by hundreds of commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web\r\nsites around the world to distribute scanned documents, digital documents, and\r\nhigh-resolution photos.\r\n\r\nDemos, and general information about DjVu can be found at \r\nhttp://www.djvuzone.org, or at http://www.lizardtech.com. \r\n\r\nDjVu was originally developed at AT&T Labs-Research. AT&T sold DjVu to\r\nLizardTech Inc. in March 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2- WHAT IS DJVULIBRE? \r\n=====================\r\n\r\nIn an effort to promote DjVu as a Web standard, LizardTech's management was\r\nenlightened enough to release the reference implementation of DjVu under the\r\nGNU GPL in October 2000. DjVuLibre (pronounced like the French \"déjà vu\r\nlibre\"), is an enhanced version of that code maintained by the original\r\ninventors of DjVu. It is compatible with LizardTech's DjVu software v3.5.\r\n\r\nThis package includes: \r\n\r\n- An up-to-date version of the C++ DjVu Reference Library \r\n- A full-fledged wavelet-based compressor for pictures. \r\n- A simple compressor for bitonal (black and white) scanned pages. \r\n- A compressor for palettized images (a la GIF). \r\n- A full set of utilities to manipulate and assemble DjVu images and documents. \r\n- A set of decoders to convert DjVu to a number of other formats. \r\n\r\nThe full-fledged DjVu file viewer and browser plugin DjView4\r\nis available as a separate package.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
